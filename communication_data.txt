Hey, what's up?
Not much, just playing this game.
Have you tried the new update yet?
Yeah, it's pretty cool. I like the new character.
Me too. I just got a legendary drop from a loot box!
Nice, that's awesome!
I wish they would stop putting pay-to-win items in the game.
Agreed. It ruins the experience for everyone.
I'm going to wait for a sale before I buy any more in-game items.
That's a good idea. The prices can be pretty steep.
Have you seen the new emotes? They're so cool.
Yeah, I might have to buy them all.
I'm saving up for the new weapon skin. It looks amazing.
I know, right? I can't decide which one to get.
I spent way too much money on in-game items last month.
Same here. I need to be more careful with my spending.
The new store layout is so confusing, I can't find anything.
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.
I just bought the season pass. Let's play some games and level up!
Sounds good to me. I can't wait for all the new content.
